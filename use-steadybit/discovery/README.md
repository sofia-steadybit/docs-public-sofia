# Discovery

The steadybit agent discovers your system by providing meta data about potential targets as well as the context your system is running in.

Thereby, the steadybit agents collects information about the following target types:

* [Host Targets](host.md)
* [Container Targets](container.md)
* [Application Targets](application.md)

In addition, the agent gathers information about the context where the targets are running. We support

* [Cloud Context](cloud.md) for major Cloud Providers
* [Custom Context](custom.md) for customizable on-prem solutions
