# Actions

Our steadybit platform offers you actions to be executed while attacking your system. We currently support the following actions.

* [Pod count](../../use-steadybit/actions/pod-count.md)
* [HTTP call](../../use-steadybit/actions/http-call.md)
* [Prometheus Metrics](../../use-steadybit/actions/prometheus.md)
* [Postman](../../use-steadybit/actions/postman.md)


# Loadtests
We recommend to have a base load in the system in order to perform experiments. To achieve that you can integrate your load test into steadybit and execute a load test automatically.

Therefore, we can trigger one of the following load tests

* [K6](../../use-steadybit/actions/k6.md)
* [JMeter](../../use-steadybit/actions/jmeter.md)
* [Gatling](../../use-steadybit/actions/gatling.md)

In case you are new to load tests and haven't chosen a framework yet, we recommend you to choose K6.
