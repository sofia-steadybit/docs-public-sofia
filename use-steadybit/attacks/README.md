# Attacks

## Attacks

Our steadybit platform offers you extensive, safe and customizable attacks. The scope of the attacks covers the following categories:

* [JVM Application](application.md)
* [Network](network.md)
* [Resource](resource.md)
* [State](state.md)
* [Kubernetes](kubernetes.md)
* [AWS Cloud Attacks](aws-cloud-attacks.md)

In each category you can expect detailed configurable attacks to test and improve your system.

## Extend Steadybit

Are you missing support for a particular attack? No problem, Steadybit is extensible, allowing you to use open- and closed-source extensions to enhance its capabilities. Learn more within our [extension documentation](../../integrate-with-steadybit/extensions/)!
