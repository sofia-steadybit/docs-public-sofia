# Monitoring

Keeping an eye on your system while making chaos is crucical. Therefore, you can use your monitoring integration to check the health of the system during the execution of experiments.

To achieve that you have to [configure your monitoring system once](../content/install-configure/70-configure-monitoring/) and afterwards [learn how to integrate monitoring during executions here](../content/integrate/30-monitoring/).
