# Checks

The Steadybit platform offers you checks to be executed while attacking your system. We currently support the following checks.

* [Pod count](pod-count.md)
* [HTTP call](http-call.md)
* [Prometheus Metrics](prometheus.md)
* [Postman](postman.md)

## Extend Steadybit

Are you missing support for a particular check? No problem, Steadybit is extensible, allowing you to use open- and closed-source extensions to enhance its capabilities. Learn more within our [extension documentation](../../integrate-with-steadybit/extensions/)!
