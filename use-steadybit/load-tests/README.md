# Load Tests

We recommend to have a base load in the system in order to perform experiments. To achieve that you can integrate your load test into steadybit and execute a load test automatically.

Therefore, we can trigger one of the following load tests

* [K6](k6.md)
* [JMeter](jmeter.md)
* [Gatling](gatling.md)

In case you are new to load tests and haven't chosen a framework yet, we recommend you to choose K6.
