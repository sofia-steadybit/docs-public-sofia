# Instana

Instana is a fully automated Application Performance Management (APM) solution designed specifically for the challenges of managing microservice and cloud-native applications.

Once Instana has been [configured](../../content/install-configure/70-configure-monitoring/20-instana/) by your admin, you will automatically find all events of `Instana` in the [execution view](../../content/use/10-experiments/20-run/) of an experiment.
