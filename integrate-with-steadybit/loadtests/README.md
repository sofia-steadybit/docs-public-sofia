# Load Tests

We recommend to have a base load in the system in order to perform experiments. To achieve that you can integrate your load test into steadybit and execute a load test automatically.

Therefore, we can trigger one of the following load tests

* [Gatling](../../content/integrate/20-loadtests/10-gatling/)
* [JMeter](../../content/integrate/20-loadtests/20-jmeter/)
* [K6](../../content/integrate/20-loadtests/30-k6/)

In case you are new to load tests and haven't chosen a framework yet, we recommend you to choose K6.
