# K6

[K6](https://k6.io/) is a developer-centric, free and open-source load testing tool built for making performance testing a productive and enjoyable experience. You can integrate the execution of K6 load tests directly into your experiments.

### Integrate K6 Load Tests

To use K6 you need to upload your K6-Test-Script. This can be done simply by adding a step of type "Loadtest", choose "K6" as Loadtest-Type and use the provided File-Upload.

#### Parameters

Within the K6 load test you have access to your provided parameters as environment variables. You can use them in the script via e.g. `${__ENV.DURATION}` as shown in the attached [example.js](../../content/integrate/20-loadtests/attachments/k6/example.js). The parameter `DURATION` is always accessible in your script, it contains the estimated total duration of your experiment, based on the duration of the other steps in seconds.

If you don't know where to start, feel free to use our [example.js](../../content/integrate/20-loadtests/attachments/k6/example.js). It is a very basic script and will just perform some HTTP-Calls on a specified endpoint. You can find a table of parameters below:

\| Parameter | Environment Variable | Description | Default | |----------|-------------|-------------|-------------|-------------| | Duration | DURATION | How long should the load test run? | inherited from experiment duration | | Virtual Users | VUS | How many virtual users should be started? | | | Target URL | TARGETURL | Which url should be targeted? | |

#### Report

After execution, the K6 report `/tmp/report/report.json` will be transferred to the platform.
