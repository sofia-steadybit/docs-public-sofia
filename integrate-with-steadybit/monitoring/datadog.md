# Datadog

Datadog is a monitoring service for cloud-scale applications, providing monitoring of servers, databases, tools, and services, through a SaaS-based data analytics platform. With the Datadog Monitor State Check we can react to the triggered alerts and use them for automatic steady state checks in experiments.

Once Datadog has been [configured](../../content/install-configure/70-configure-monitoring/10-datadog/) by your admin, you will automatically find all events of `Datadog` in the [execution view](../../content/use/10-experiments/20-run/) of an experiment.
