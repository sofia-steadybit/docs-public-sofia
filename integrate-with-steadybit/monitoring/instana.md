# Instana

Instana is a fully automated Application Performance Management (APM) solution designed specifically for the challenges of managing microservice and cloud-native applications.

Once Instana has been [configured](../../install-and-configure/configure-monitoring/instana.md) by your admin, you will automatically find all events of `Instana` in the [execution view ](../../use-steadybit/experiments/#run)of an experiment.
