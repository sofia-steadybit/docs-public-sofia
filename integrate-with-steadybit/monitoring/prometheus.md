title: "Prometheus"
---

Prometheus is able to manage so-called alerts and trigger them in certain situations. With our integration we can react to the alerts and use them for automatic steady state checks in experiments.

Once Prometheus has been [configured](../../install-configure/configure-monitoring/40-prometheus) by your admin, you will automatically find all events of `Prometheus` in
the [execution view](../../use/experiments/20-run) of an experiment.
In addition, you can make use of the [Prometheus Metrics](../../use/actions/30-prometheus) as part of an experiment.
