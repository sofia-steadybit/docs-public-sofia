# Prometheus

Prometheus is able to manage so-called alerts and trigger them in certain situations. With our integration we can react to the alerts and use them for automatic steady state checks in experiments.

* [Read more about Prometheus alerts](https://prometheus.io/docs/alerting/overview/)

{% hint style="info" %}
Use the new open-source Steadybit Extension to integrate Prometheus into Steadybit. You can find the extension in the [Reliability Hub](https://hub.steadybit.com/extension/com.github.steadybit.extension_prometheus).
