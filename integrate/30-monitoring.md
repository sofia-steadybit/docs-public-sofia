Keeping an eye on your system while making chaos is crucical. Therefore, you can use your monitoring integration to check the health of the system during the
execution of experiments. In case something unusal happens experiments are aborted automatically to prevent further harm. We automatically check the state
before, during and after the execution of an experiment.

In order to make use of a monitoring integration you have to [configure them once](../install-configure/70-configure-monitoring).
