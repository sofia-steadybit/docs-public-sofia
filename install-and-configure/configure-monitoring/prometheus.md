# Prometheus

Prometheus is able to manage so-called alerts and trigger them in certain situations. With our integration we can react to the alerts and use them for automatic steady state checks in experiments.
Check out the [Prometheus documentation about alerts](https://prometheus.io/docs/alerting/overview/) if you want to learn more.

{% hint style="info" %}
Integrating Prometheus into Steadybit works via our new open-source Extension!<br/>
You can find more documentation about the extension in the [Reliability Hub](https://hub.steadybit.com/extension/com.github.steadybit.extension_prometheus).
