# Datadog

Datadog is a monitoring service for cloud-scale applications, providing monitoring of servers, databases, tools, and services, through a SaaS-based data analytics platform. With the Datadog monitor status check we can react to the triggered alerts and use them for automatic steady state checks in experiments.
