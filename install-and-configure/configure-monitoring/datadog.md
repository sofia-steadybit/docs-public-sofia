# Datadog

Datadog is a monitoring service for cloud-scale applications, providing monitoring of servers, databases, tools, and services, through a SaaS-based data analytics platform. With the Datadog monitor status check we can react to the triggered alerts and use them for automatic steady state checks in experiments.

#### Configuration

To leverage the Datadog capability, you need to install our Datadog extension. Please refer to the [extension's installation guidelines](https://github.com/steadybit/extension-datadog).

#### Usage

Once Datadog has been configured in the platform's settings, you can use the `Datadog Monitor Status Check` in an experiment. Detailed explanation can be found in [Integrate / Monitoring / Datadog](../../integrate-with-steadybit/monitoring/datadog.md).
