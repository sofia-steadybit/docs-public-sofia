# Datadog

Datadog is a monitoring service for cloud-scale applications, providing monitoring of servers, databases, tools, and services, through a SaaS-based data analytics platform. With the Datadog monitor status check we can react to the triggered alerts and use them for automatic steady state checks in experiments.

Integrating Datadog into Steadybit works via our open-source Extension!<br/>
You can find more documentation about the extension in the [Reliability Hub](https://hub.steadybit.com/extension/com.steadybit.extension_datadog).
