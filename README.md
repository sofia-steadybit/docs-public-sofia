# Welcome to Steadybit

Steadybit provides visibility into your systems to proactively identify resilience issues and reduce downtime. We follow the principles of chaos engineering and help you stay in control of your chaos experiments.

## Getting started with Steadybit

We use an agent-based approach consisting of a central SaaS platform - being the center of control for you - and agents - deployed in your system to discover running hosts, containers and applications.

If you are new to resilience engineering, use our "Quick Start" to begin and run your first assisted experiments. If you are a pro already, look at the detailed docs and dive into the depth of our software.

[Contact us](https://www.steadybit.com/contact) if you need help.
