# Welcome to Steadybit

Steadybit provides you visibility into your systems to detect resilience issues proactively and reduce downtime. We follow the principles of Chaos Engineering and help you to stay in control of your chaos experiments.

## Getting started with Steadybit

We use an agent-based approach consisting of a central SaaS platform - being the center of control for you - and agents - deployed in your system to discover running hosts, containers and applications.

Just follow these few steps to get started:

1. Sign up for a new account [on our Website](https://www.steadybit.com/get-started/)
2. [Install agents](content/getting-started/10-set-up-platform-agents/) to discover your system
   * if you like, you can deploy an [example application on Minikube or AWS EKS](content/getting-started/15-deploy-example-application/) beforehand to easier play around with Steadybit
3. Start using Steadybit by
   * [defining your resilience expectations](content/getting-started/20-define-resilience-expectations/) for your services
   * or by [designing and running your first experiment](content/getting-started/30-run-experiment/)
