## Introduction
This guide helps you with the initial setup of our steadybit platform and leads you step by step through the first setup.
There are environments and conditions where it is not yet possible to take advantage of a SaaS environment.
Therefore, we also provide our platform as a self-hosted variant.

If you want to use our self-hosted service, you have already received an invitation in advance and can register with your credentials under [https://platform.steadybit.io/](https://platform.steadybit.io/)
