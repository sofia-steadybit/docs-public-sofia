This guide helps you with the initial setup of our steadybit platform On-Prem and leads you step by step through the first setup.
It is explicitly of use for environments where it is not yet possible to take advantage of our SaaS platform and the need to self-host our platform.

>If you are interested in using and setting up our platform as a SaaS, let us know and read on with how to get started to [set up the SaaS Platform](10-set-up-saas).
>



If you want to use our self-hosted service, you have already received an invitation in advance and can register with your credentials under [https://platform.steadybit.io/](https://platform.steadybit.io/)
