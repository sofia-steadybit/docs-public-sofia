The chaosmesh API allows to read experiment designs, executions and killswitch status.
It also allows to run and cancel experiments and enables integration into CI/CD.

The **base URL** for the API is the same that you use for accessing the user interface.

A valid **access token** is required to issue requests to the API.
Access tokens can be generated by admins or team owners via the user interface (Settings > Access Tokens).

### Example

Here is an example request to use the api with `curl`. It fetches all runnable experiment designs:
```shell script
curl -H"Authorization: accessToken xxxxxxxx.xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx" https://platform.chaosmesh.io/api/experiments?runnable
```

### OpenApi Specification

We provide a [OpenApi 3.0 Specification](https://www.openapis.org/) for the API on https://platform.chaosmesh.io/api/spec.json.
In case you are using our on-prem variant you can access it at `http://<your-installation-url>/api/spec.json`.
