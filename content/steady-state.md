One of the most important parts of Chaos Engineering is to understand the behavior of the system under normal conditions.

Our platform can automatically monitor this behavior with the provided integration. We automatically check the steady state before, during and after the execution of an experiment.

Steady State integrations:

* [Prometheus](steady-state/1-prometheus)
* [Instana](steady-state/2-instana)
* [HTTP](steady-state/3-http-check)
