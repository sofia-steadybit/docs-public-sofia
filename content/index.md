## Welcome to steadybit
Our steadybit platform that helps to proactively reduce downtime and provide visibility into systems to detect issues.
We follow the principles of Chaos Engineering and help you to stay in control of your chaos experiments.

To use steadybit, you can use our platform as Software as a Service (SaaS) or [run it locally](installation-platform/) in your own infrastructure (on-prem).

Once you have an environment available, the next step is to [install an agent](installation-agent/) on each of your hosts to run experiments.

If you need additional help, [contact](https://steadybit.com/contact/) us.
