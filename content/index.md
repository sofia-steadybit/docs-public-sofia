## Welcome to steadybit

Steadybit helps you to proactively reduce downtime and provides visibility into your systems to detect resilience issues. We follow the principles of Chaos
Engineering and help you to stay in control of your chaos experiments.

Steadybit uses an agent-based approach consisting of a central platform - being the center of control for you - and agents - deployed in your system to discover running hosts, containers and applications.
