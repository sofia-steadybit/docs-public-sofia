## Introduction
We have prepared a series of useful guides and docs to make your start with steadybit as smooth as possible.

### Setting up steadybit
As you have already notice, you can use our SaaS service or rely on the self-hosted version.
The following two guides allow you to get started quickly and lead you through the necessary steps.

* [Running steadybit on our SaaS Platform](getting-started/1-getting-started-saas)
* [Running steadybit self-hosted (on-prem)](getting-started/2-getting-started-onprem)

### Getting started in Kubernetes
In the following getting started guides we assume that our platform is configured and available.

* [How to install & use steadybit with Kubernetes locally](getting-started/3-kubernetes)
* [How to install & use steadybit with AWS EKS Kubernetes](getting-started/4-aws-eks-kubernetes)
