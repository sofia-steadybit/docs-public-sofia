## Prerequisites

We take an agent-based approach at steadybit. Our agents communicate with the steadybit platform, which is either operated by us as a SaaS platform or by you as
an on-prem variant. In this getting started we assume that this platform is available. If you have questions about the on-prem variant, please have a look at
our docs and contact us.
