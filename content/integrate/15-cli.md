The [steadybit CLI](https://github.com/steadybit/cli) allows you to connect your repository to steadybit.

### Intention

With the CLI you can connect your repositories to steadybit. So you are able to link your deployment with Steadybit via attributes in a yml file and define
resilience requirements for it. These resilience requirements can then be validated with Steadybit.

### Installation

Nothing more than a simple

```bash
npm install -g steadybit
```

### Usage

The CLI is mostly self explaining. For a detailed documentatio have a look at our public GitHub repository [steadybit CLI](https://github.com/steadybit/cli)
