Prometheus is able to manage so-called alerts and trigger them in certain situations. With our integration we can react to the alerts and use them for automatic steady state checks in experiments.

Once Prometheus has been [configured](../../install-configure/70-configure-monitoring/40-prometheus) by your admin, you will find a button to `Add Prometheus Steady State Check` in the experiment creation dialog.
