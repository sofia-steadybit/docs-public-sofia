Instana is a fully automated Application Performance Management (APM) solution designed specifically for the challenges of managing microservice and
cloud-native applications.

Once Instana has been [configured](../../install-configure/70-configure-monitoring/20-instana) by your admin, you will automatically find all events of `Instana` in
the [execution view](../../use/10-experiments/20-run) of an experiment.
