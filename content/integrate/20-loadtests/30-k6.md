[K6](https://k6.io/) is a developer-centric, free and open-source load testing tool built for making performance testing a productive and enjoyable experience.
You can integrate the execution of K6 load tests directly into your experiments.

### Usage

When using the default, the load test will perform a GET request every second on the target url with the number of virtual users.

### Parameters

| Parameter   | Environment Variable   |      Description      | Default | Required |
|----------|-------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|
| Duration | DURATION | How long should the load test run? | inherited from experiment duration | no |
| Virtual Users | VUS | How many virtual users should be started? | 1 | yes |
| Docker Image | - |  Which image should be used for executing the action? |steadybit/action-k6:latest | yes |
| Path to JSON report | - | The json report at this location will be shown in the report after experiment execution. | /tmp/report/report.json | no |

### Custom K6 Tests
For using a custom load test you can exchange the `/script.js` file with your custom one.

```
# Inherit existing image
FROM steadybit/action-k6:latest

# provide custom test
COPY custom.js /script.js
```

#### Extended explanation

1. Create a custom.scala K6 file. At best you use the attached [custom.js](content/integrate/20-loadtests/attachments/k6/custom.js) file as starting point, as it demonstrates how the passed in parameters are used.
2. Put the custom.jmx and the attached [Dockerfile](attachments/k6/Dockerfile) into the same directory and run the following command in the same directory: docker build --tag `<your-docker-hub-huser>/action-k6:latest` .
3. Login to dockerhub: docker login
4. Push the image docker push `<your-docker-hub-huser>/action-k6:latest`
5. In the experiment with the K6 load test use `<your-docker-hub-huser>/action-k6:latest` for the Docker Image parameter.
6. Only in case the image is not public and requires authentication to be pulled: configure the Pull-Secrets in the platform via Application Settings -> Agents -> Pull Secrets
   Tip: Instead of the dockerhub registry you can also use a custom one - you then need to use a prefixed image tag and the correct login
