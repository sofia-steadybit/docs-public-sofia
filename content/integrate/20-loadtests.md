title: "Load Tests"
---

We recommend to have a base load in the system in order to perform experiments. To achieve that you can integrate your load test into steadybit.

To achieve that you can [learn how to trigger load tests here](../learn/50-trigger-loadtests).

In case you are new to load tests and haven't chosen a framework yet, we recommend you to choose K6.
