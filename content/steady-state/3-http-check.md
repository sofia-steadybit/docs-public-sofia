## HTTP
The check issues an http `GET` request on the specified URL and asserts the returned status to be successful.
The URL must be reachable from the platform server.

### Usage
Since the HTTP Steady State Check does not require any previous configuration, you will always find a button to `Add HTTP Steady State Check` in the experiment creation dialog.
