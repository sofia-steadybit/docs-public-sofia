title: "Trigger Load Tests"
---

To perform experiments it is recommended to have a base load in the system. With steadybit it is possible to execute a load test automatically.

Therefore, we can trigger one of the following load tests
- [Gatling](50-trigger-loadtests/10-gatling)
- [JMeter](50-trigger-loadtests/20-jmeter)
- [K6](50-trigger-loadtests/30-k6)
