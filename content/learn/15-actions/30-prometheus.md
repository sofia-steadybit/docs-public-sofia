title: "Prometheus Metrics"
---
Once Prometheus has been [configured](../../install-configure/70-configure-monitoring/40-prometheus) by your admin, you can check for specific Prometheus metrics in the experiment.
Therefore, you need to define the `Metric Name`, `Label` and `Label Value` of your metric.
Furthermore, you should review the threshold which defines in the end whether the experiment is successful or failed.
