title: "Load Tests"

We recommend to have a base load in the system in order to perform experiments. To achieve that you can integrate your load test into steadybit.

In order to so, [learn how to integrate your load tests](../integrate/20-loadtests).

In case you are new to load tests and haven't chosen a framework yet, we recommend you to choose K6.
