title: "HTTP Check"
---

The check issues a HTTP `GET` request on the specified URL and asserts the returned status to be successful (HTTP status 2xx). Therefore, the URL must be
reachable from the platform server.

You can configure the `HTTP Status`-Monitoring in the section `Execution and Monitoring` within the configuration dialog of an experiment.
