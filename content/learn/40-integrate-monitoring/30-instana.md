Instana is a fully automated Application Performance Management (APM) solution designed specifically for the challenges of managing microservice and
cloud-native applications.

Once Instana has been [configured](../../install-configure/70-configure-monitoring/20-instana) by your admin, you will find a button `Instana State Check` in section `Execution and Monitoring` within the
configuration dialog of an experiment.
