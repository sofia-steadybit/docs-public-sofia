title: "Datadog"

Datadog is a monitoring service for cloud-scale applications, providing monitoring of servers, databases, tools, and services, through a SaaS-based data
analytics platform. With the Datadog Monitor State Check we can react to the triggered alerts and use them for automatic steady state checks in experiments.

Once Datadog has been [configured](../../install-configure/70-configure-monitoring/10-datadog) by your admin, you will find a `Datadog State Check` in
section `Execution and Monitoring` within the configuration dialog of an experiment.

You only have to choose a Datadog Monitor from the list you want to check during the experiment execution. To learn more about this topic, just check out these
URLs and create the Monitors you need for your specific use case.
