The following command will download and run the latest steadybit agent package on your system:

```shell
curl -sfL https://get.steadybit.io/agent-linux.sh | sh -s -- -a <agent-k**ey> -e <platform-url>
```

For your convenience you can use the [setup page](https://platform.steadybit.io/settings/agents/setup) in the SaaS platform, where your agent key is already prepared in the command.
