> Continue, if you want to install the cloud service agent to attack AWS cloud resources.
> In case you are interested in host based attacks, attacking e.g. the host and software running on it, refer to [Docker](30-install-agents/10-docker)

## Capabilities

The cloud service agent uses cloud apis to interact with cloud resources.

The current features are:

- Discover and shutdown EC2 instances
- Blackhole Availability Zones
- Integrate AWS FIS Experiments

We recommend running the cloud agent in a separate subnet to be sure that the agent is still working properly, when you are attacking the cloud resources. The
subnet of the agent will be excluded from network based attacks like the Blackhole Zone Attack.

## Required permissions for AWS API Access

For querying metadata and using the AWS API executing the attacks a suitable IAM role needs to be created.

The following policies needs to be attached to the IAM role. If you don't want to provide permission for a particular feature, you can disable the discovery by
creating an environment variable `STEADYBIT_AGENT_DISCOVERIES_DISABLED` containing a comma separated list of discovery names.

- EC2-Instance Discovery and Attack:
  - Discovery-Name: Ec2InstancesDiscovery
  - Required Policy

- Availability Zone Discovery and Zone Blackhole Attack:

- Integrate AWS FIS Experiments:

## Authentication

The agent is using the [default credentials provider chain](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-java/latest/developer-guide/credentials.html#credentials-chain).
You can pass credentials using the following sequence:

1. Java System Properties (`aws.accessKeyId` and `aws.secretAccessKey`)
2. Environment variables (`AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`)
3. Web identity token from AWS STS
4. The shared credentials and config files
5. Amazon ECS container credentials
6. Amazon EC2 instance profile credentials

You can find more information about best matching ways to provide credentials in the following installation guides.

## Multiple Instances

If you want to run multiple instances of the AWS-Cloud-Agent you need to consider, that the agent needs a unique identifier. By default, the hostname is used
for that. If you are running multiple instances on the same host, you can provide an identifier via `STEADYBIT_AGENT_IDENTIFIER`.

If you are using our helm charts to install an AWS-Cloud-Agent, you currently need to use an own namespace for each agent. The namespace is then used as
identifier.
