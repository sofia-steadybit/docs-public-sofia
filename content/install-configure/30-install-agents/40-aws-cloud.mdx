> Continue, if you want to install the cloud service agent to attack AWS cloud resources.
> In case you are interested in host based attacks, attacking e.g. the host and software running on it, refer to [Docker](30-install-agents/10-docker)
> , [Kubernetes](30-install-agents/20-kubernetes) or [Linux Hosts](30-install-agents/30-host) installation documentation.

## Capabilitities

The cloud service agent uses cloud apis to interact with cloud resources.

The current features are:

- Discover and shutdown EC2 instances
- Blackhole Availablity Zones
- Integrate AWS FIS Experiments

We recommend running the cloud agent in a separate subnet to be sure that the agent is still working properly, when you are attacking the cloud resources. The
subnet of the agent will be excluded from network based attacks like the Blackhole Zone Attack.

## Required permissions for AWS API Access

For querying metadata and using the AWS API executing the attacks a suitable IAM role needs to be created.

The following policies needs to be attached to the IAM role. If you don't want to provide permission for a particular feature, you can disable the discovery by
creating an environment variable `STEADYBIT_AGENT_DISCOVERIES_DISABLED` containing a comma seprated list of discovery names.

- EC2-Instance Discovery and Attack:
  - Discovery-Name: Ec2InstancesDiscovery
<Collapsible title={'Required Policy'}>
  <PolicyEc2Instances/>
</Collapsible>

- Availability Zone Discovery and Zone Blackhole Attack:
  - Discovery-Name: AvailabilityZoneDiscovery
<Collapsible title={'Required Policy'}>
  <PolicyAvailabilityZone/>
</Collapsible>

- Integrate AWS FIS Experiments:
  - Discovery-Name: FisExperimentTemplateDiscovery
<Collapsible title={'Required Policy'}>
  <PolicyFisExperiments/>
</Collapsible>

## Installation on EC2 Instance

The following command will download and run the latest steadybit agent package on your EC2 instance:

```shell
curl -sfL https://get.steadybit.io/agent-linux.sh | sh -s -- -a <agent-key> -e <platform-url> -o aws
```

For your convenience you can use the [setup page](https://platform.steadybit.io/settings/agents/setup) in the SaaS platform, where your agent key is already
prepared in the command.

See also the [Amazon ECS Container Instance documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/launch_container_instance.html)
for using User Data mechanism on new EC2 instances to automate the agent installation.

      {
        "Effect": "Allow",
        "Principal": {
          "Service": [

        "Action": "sts:AssumeRole"
      }
    ]
  }
```

## Installation as ECS Task

### Secret for accessing the agent image

First you need to [create a secret](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/latest/userguide/manage_create-basic-secret.html)
for accessing our private Docker Registry (docker.steadybit.io) to download the agent image.

```
{
  "username": "_",
  "password": "<replace-with-agent-key>"
}
```

### Example

For your convenience we have prepared an example task definition to use for ECS in EC2 (or FARGATE). Please fill in the missing "replace-with" prefixed fields:

```
{
    "family": "steadybit-agent",
    "requiresCompatibilities": [
        "<EC2 or FARGATE>"
    ],
    "networkMode": "awsvpc",
    "cpu": "512",
    "memory": "1024",
    "taskRoleArn": "<replace-with-task-role-arn>",
    "executionRoleArn": "<replace-with-execution-role-arn>",
    "containerDefinitions": [
        {
            "portMappings": [],
            "environment": [
                {
                    "name": "STEADYBIT_AGENT_KEY",
                    "value": "<replace-with-agent-key>"
                },
                {
                    "name": "STEADYBIT_AGENT_MODE",
                    "value": "aws"
                }
            ],
            "repositoryCredentials": {
              "credentialsParameter": "<replace-with-secret-arn-from-secretmanager>"
            },
            "image": "docker.steadybit.io/steadybit/agent:latest",
            "name": "steadybit-agent"
        }
    ]
}
```

### Trust Relationship for ECS

```
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
      {
        "Effect": "Allow",
        "Principal": {
          "Service": [
            "ecs-tasks.amazonaws.com"
          ]
        },
        "Action": "sts:AssumeRole"
      }
    ]
  }
```

## Installation in EKS

You can use our helm-chart with the parameter `agent.mode=aws`.

### Authorization in EKS with WebIdentityTokenFileCredentialsProvider

Compare to [AWS: IAM roles for service accounts](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/iam-roles-for-service-accounts.html)

1. Create an OIDC Provider
2. Create an IAM Role with the Policy from above
3. Allow the Role to be "assumed" by the OIDC Provider

```
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Principal": {
                "Federated": "arn:aws:iam::<ACCOUNT>:oidc-provider/oidc.eks.<REGION>.amazonaws.com/id/<ID>"
            },
            "Action": "sts:AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity",
            "Condition": {
                "StringEquals": {
                    "oidc.eks.<REGION>.amazonaws.com/id/<ID>:aud": "sts.amazonaws.com",
                    "oidc.eks.<REGION>.amazonaws.com/id/<ID>:sub": "system:serviceaccount:<SERVICE-ACCOUNT-NAMESPACE>:<SERVICE-ACCOUNT-NAME>"
                }
            }
        }
    ]
}
```

4. Associate the IAM Role to your Kubernetes Service Account. If you are using our helm charts to create the Service Account, you can use the
   parameter `serviceAccount.eksRoleArn`.

## Running outside of AWS

You can also dedicate any agent running outside of your AWS infrastructure to communicate with the AWS API. In this case you need to setup an IAM with API
credentials which is allowed to access the resources already described in the section above.

The following variables needs to be added to the environment configuration:

```
AWS_REGION=<replace-with-region-to-attack>
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=<replace-with-aws-access-key>
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=<replace-with-aws-secret-access-key>
```

## Multiple Instances

If you want to run multiple instances of the AWS-Cloud-Agent you need to consider, that the agent needs an unique identifier. By default the hostname is used
for that. If you are running multiple instances on the same host, you can provide a identifier via `STEADYBIT_AGENT_IDENTIFIER`.

If you are using our helm charts to install an AWS-Cloud-Agent, you currently need to use a own namespace for each agent. The namespace is then used as
identifier.
