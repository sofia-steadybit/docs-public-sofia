## Capabilities

The cloud service agent uses cloud apis to interact with cloud resources.

The current features are:

- Discover and shutdown EC2 instances
- Blackhole Availability Zones
- Integrate AWS FIS Experiments

## Required permissions for AWS API Access

For querying metadata and using the AWS API executing the attacks a suitable IAM role needs to be created.

The following policies needs to be attached to the IAM role. If you don't want to provide permission for a particular feature, you can disable the discovery by
creating an environment variable `STEADYBIT_AGENT_DISCOVERIES_DISABLED` containing a comma separated list of discovery names.

- EC2-Instance Discovery and Attack:
- Discovery-Name: Ec2InstancesDiscovery
- Required Policy

  <PolicyEc2Instances/>

- Availability Zone Discovery and Zone Blackhole Attack:
- Discovery-Name: AvailabilityZoneDiscovery
- Required Policy

  <PolicyAvailabilityZone/>
</Collapsible>

- Integrate AWS FIS Experiments:
- Discovery-Name: FisExperimentTemplateDiscovery
- Required Policy
<Collapsible title={'Show'}>
  <PolicyFisExperiments/>
</Collapsible>

## Authentication

The agent is using the [default credentials provider chain](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-java/latest/developer-guide/credentials.html#credentials-chain).
You can pass credentials using the following sequence:

1. Java System Properties (`aws.accessKeyId` and `aws.secretAccessKey`)
2. Environment variables (`AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`)
3. Web identity token from AWS STS
4. The shared credentials and config files
5. Amazon ECS container credentials
6. Amazon EC2 instance profile credentials

You can find more information about best matching ways to provide credentials in the following installation guides.

## Assume-Role into multiple AWS accounts

By default, the agent uses the provided credentials to discover all resources in the belonging AWS account.

Another option is to provide a comma separated list of role-ARNs via the environment variable `STEADYBIT_AGENT_AWS_ASSUME_ROLE_LIST`. The provided credentials
are then only used to assume-role into the given role-ARNs.

In this case make sure:
- The provided credentials are allowed to assume the provided role-ARNs.
  - Policy Example to allow AssumeRole
  ```
  {
      "Version": "2012-10-17",
      "Statement": [
          {
              "Effect": "Allow",
              "Action": "sts:AssumeRole",
              "Resource": "arn:aws:iam::<TARGET-ACCOUNT>:role/steadybit-agent"
          }
      ]
  }
  ```
- The given roles themself have all [required permissions](#required-permissions-for-aws-api-access).
- The given roles do have trust relationship to allow to be assumed by the given credentials.
  - Example trust relationship
  ```
  {
      "Version": "2012-10-17",
      "Statement": [
          {
              "Effect": "Allow",
              "Principal": {
                  "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::<ACCOUNT-RUNNING-THE-AGENT>:<ROLE-RUNNING-THE-AGENT>"
              },
              "Action": "sts:AssumeRole",
              "Condition": {}
          }
      ]
  }
  ```

## F.A.Q

Q: Can I run multiple instances of the agent on the same host?

A: Yes, you can. If you want to run multiple instances of the AWS-Cloud-Agent you need to consider, that the agent needs a unique identifier. By default, the hostname is used
for that. If you are running multiple instances on the same host, you need to provide an identifier via `STEADYBIT_AGENT_IDENTIFIER`.

---

Q: Can I run multiple instances of the agent using the helm chart?

A: Yes, but you currently need to use an own namespace for each agent. The namespace is then used as identifier.

---

Q: How can I make sure, that I don't attack the agent itself?

A: We recommend running the cloud agent in a separate subnet to be sure that the agent is still working properly, when you are attacking the cloud resources. The
subnet of the agent will be excluded from network based attacks like the Blackhole Zone Attack.
