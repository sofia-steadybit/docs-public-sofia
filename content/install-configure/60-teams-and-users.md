Steadybit lives transparency by allowing every user to see the performed actions of other teams and users. Even so, a Role-Based-Access-Control (RBAC) give you
the possibility to control fine-grained permissions and determine on which parts users can take action.

* Start by defining your [Teams](60-teams-and-users/10-teams)
* Invite and assign [Users](60-teams-and-users/20-users) to the teams
* Learn more about [Permissions and Roles](60-teams-and-users/30-permissions)
