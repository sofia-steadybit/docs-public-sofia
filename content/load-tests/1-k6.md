## K6

k6 is a developer-centric, free and open-source load testing tool built for making performance testing a productive and enjoyable experience.
With our integration you can integrate the execution of K6 load tests directly into your experiments.

[Read more about K6](https://k6.io/docs/)

### Configuration

| Parameter   | Environment Variable   |      Description      | Default | Required |
|----------|-------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|
| Duration | DURATION | How long should the load test run? | inherited from experiment duration | no |
| Virtual Users | VUS | How many virtual users should be started? | 1 | yes |
| Target URL | TARGETURL | Which url should be the target for the load test? | - | yes |
| Docker Image | - |  Which image should be used for executing the action? |steadybit/action-k6:latest | yes |
| Path to JSON report | - | The json report at this location will be shown in the report after experiment execution. | /tmp/report/report.json | no |

### Usage

When you are using our default Docker image ('steadybit/action-k6:latest') then the following load test will be executed during the experiment:

```
import http from 'k6/http';
import { check, sleep } from 'k6';

export default function () {
    let response = http.get(`${__ENV.TARGETURL}`);
    check(response, { 'status was 200': r => r.status == 200 });
    sleep(1);
}
```

The `entrypoint.sh` script contains the other parameters which are necessary for running a K6 load test:

```
#!/bin/sh -l
mkdir -p /tmp/report
echo "Executing k6 load test against target url ${TARGETURL} with duration ${DURATION} and ${VUS} VUs"
k6 run -e TARGETURL=${TARGETURL} --vus ${VUS} --duration ${DURATION}s --out json=/tmp/report/report.json --summary-export=/tmp/report/summary.json --no-usage-report script.js
```

Of course it is also possible to store your own script or customize the `entrypoint.sh`. All you have to do is to provide your own Docker image, which contains the corresponding script:

```
# Inherit existing image
FROM steadybit/action-k6:latest

# provide custom test
COPY script.js /script.js

#optional
COPY entrypoint.sh /entrypoint.sh

ENTRYPOINT [ "sh", "-c", "/entrypoint.sh" ]
```
